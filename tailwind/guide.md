🧱 The right mental model for Tailwind

Think in layers, not features:

Core ideas

Layout

Spacing & sizing

Typography

Colors & effects

State & responsiveness

Composition patterns

Customization

Each layer should have:

a why

a small demo

a gotcha

📁 How to structure your Tailwind study (recommended)

Create one file per topic, like you did with JS:

tailwind/
├── 01-core-concepts.html
├── 02-layout.html
├── 03-spacing-sizing.html
├── 04-typography.html
├── 05-colors-effects.html
├── 06-responsive-states.html
├── 07-composition-patterns.html
├── 08-config-theme.md


Each file follows the same template.
